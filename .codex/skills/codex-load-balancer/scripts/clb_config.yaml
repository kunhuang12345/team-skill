# codex-load-balancer config
#
# `sources` is a comma-separated list of CODEX_HOME template directories.
# Each directory should contain its own Codex config/auth (so many workers can
# spread across multiple accounts/credentials).
#
# Examples:
#   sources: "~/.codex, ~/.codex-account-b, /mnt/d/codex-homes/account-c"
#
# Strategy:
# - round_robin (default): picks sources sequentially (persists counter in state_file)
# - hash: stable selection based on worker name (no state)
#
# state_file is only used for round_robin (relative to skill root if not absolute).
sources: ""
strategy: round_robin
state_file: "share/state.json"

# Required when using auth balancing (called by tmux-workflow when twf_use_load_balancer=true):
# A directory containing multiple auth files (contents are Codex auth JSON).
# File names are unrestricted; picked file content will be copied into each worker home as `auth.json`.
auth_team_dir: ""

# Optional file glob under auth_team_dir (default: all files).
# Example: "auth.json.*" or "*.json"
auth_team_glob: "*"
