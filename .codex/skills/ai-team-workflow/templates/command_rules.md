# Team Command Governance (Mandatory)

This rule applies to **every role** in this AI team.

## Allowed messaging path (required)

- **Send messages only via** `atwf` wrappers (policy-enforced):
  - Notice (FYI, no reply expected): `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf notice ...`
  - Action (instruction, no immediate ACK): `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf action ...`
  - Reply-needed (must reply): `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf gather ...` / `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf respond ...`
  - Direct question (discouraged; may require CLI injection): `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf ask ...`
  - Handoff/authorization (avoid relaying): `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf handoff ...`
  - Legacy (operator-only): `atwf send` / `atwf broadcast` (disabled inside worker tmux; use `notice` / `action`)
- Check hard permissions any time:
  - `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf policy`
  - `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf perms-self`
- Any progress/completion/design conclusion **must** be reported via `atwf report-up` (or `atwf report-to coord|liaison`) to count as “reported”; otherwise the parent may treat it as “not received”.

## Queue-safe message protocol (mandatory)

Codex TUI can collapse multiple pending messages into a single prompt (especially after `Esc`).
To keep ordering deterministic, **all atwf messages are wrapped** like:

```
[ATWF-MSG id=000123 kind=send from=<full> to=<full> ts=<iso8601>]
...body...
[ATWF-END id=000123]
```

Hard rules:
- Extract all `[ATWF-MSG ...] ... [ATWF-END ...]` blocks from the prompt.
- Process blocks in **ascending numeric `id`** (oldest first), regardless of where they appear in the prompt.
- If the same `id` appears multiple times, **process it once** (dedupe).
- Reply **once per batch**. Start your reply with: `ACK ids: 000123, 000124`.
- Do not re-quote entire incoming messages; reference by `id` to save tokens.
- For `kind=send|broadcast|bootstrap|handoff|task`: keep replies minimal (ACK + any required action only).

## Inbox-backed message bodies (mandatory)

To reduce token waste and avoid “confirm storms”, **the full message body is written to a file** and the chat message only contains a short `[INBOX] id=...` notification.

Hard rules:
- For every received `id`, load the full body via: `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf inbox-open <id>`
- After you have fully processed the message, mark it read via: `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf inbox-ack <id>`
- To see your pending unread queue: `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf inbox`
- When you send many messages to the same target, check backlog first: `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf inbox-pending <target>`

## Message intents (hard protocol) (mandatory)

All cross-role messages MUST be one of:

1) `notice` (notification / FYI)
- Sender uses: `atwf notice ...`
- Receiver MUST: `inbox-open` → read → `inbox-ack`.
- Receiver MUST NOT: reply upward with “received/ok/ack” via `report-up`/`action`/`ask`.

2) `reply-needed` (explicit answer required)
- Sender uses: `atwf gather ...`
- Receiver MUST use: `atwf respond ...` (or `--blocked --snooze --waiting-on ...`).

3) `action` (instruction / task)
- Sender uses: `atwf action ...`
- Receiver MUST NOT: send an immediate ACK message.
- Receiver MUST: execute; when done, report deliverables/evidence via `report-up` (or `report-to`).

## Notice receipts (replace ACK storms) (mandatory)

To confirm “everyone read the notice”, do NOT ask for ACK replies.
Instead, query receipts by `msg_id`:

- `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf receipts <msg_id>`

Statuses:
- `unread` / `overflow` / `read` / `missing`

## Reply-needed requests (gather/respond) (mandatory)

Use this to collect multiple replies without spamming chat threads.

Hard rules:
- If you need multiple people to reply, use `atwf gather` (not N separate `ask` + repeated summaries).
  - Initiator: `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf gather <a> <b> ... --topic "..." --message "<request>"` (or via stdin)
- If you receive a `kind=reply-needed` inbox message, do **NOT** reply via `send/ask`.
  Use `atwf respond` so the system can consolidate:
  - Reply: `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf respond <req-id> "<your reply>"`
  - Blocked/snooze: `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf respond <req-id> --blocked --snooze 15m --waiting-on <base> "why blocked"`
  - List your pending reply-needed: `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf reply-needed`
- The initiator receives **one** consolidated result message (inbox-only) when all targets replied or the request times out.
- If you see a `REPLY wake:` prompt, run `atwf reply-needed` immediately and handle the oldest due request.

## CLI injection policy (mandatory)

Goal: avoid spending tokens by injecting prompts into other workers' Codex CLIs.

Hard rules:
- Default delivery is **inbox-only**: `atwf notice` / `atwf action` / `atwf report-*` write to inbox and do **not** inject into the recipient CLI.
- The **only** routine CLI injection is the operator-side watcher `atwf watch-idle`, which:
  - wakes `idle` workers when inbox has pending items
  - injects governance alerts to `coord` when `working` workers ignore inbox too long
  - may auto-send an `Enter` keystroke when an approval menu is detected (config: `team.state.auto_enter`)
- `--notify` / `--wait` are **operator-only exceptions** and should not be used during normal work.

## Agent state + standby protocol (mandatory)

State is **watcher-derived** (operator sidecar `atwf watch-idle`) to reduce token waste and avoid relying on workers to self-report.

Derived states (informational; enforced by watcher):
- `working`: watcher sees recent tmux output activity, or the worker is within a short grace period after a wake prompt.
- `idle`: watcher sees no recent output activity.

Commands:
- View your derived state: `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf state-self`
- View others: `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf state <target>`

Hard rules:
- If you are actively working (or after any wake prompt): run `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf inbox` at least once per minute (or before any blocking wait). If it lists unread `id`s, you must `inbox-open` + process + `inbox-ack` them, then continue work.
- Do **NOT** use `state-set-self` as part of normal workflow; it will be overwritten by the watcher and is only for debugging.
- When you have nothing actionable: simply wait. If new inbox arrives, the watcher will wake you with a short prompt.

## Drive loop (mandatory)

To prevent “everyone idle, nobody kicks off the next iteration”, the team uses a human-controlled drive loop.

Commands:
- Check drive mode: `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf drive`
- Set drive mode (config is authoritative):
  - edit `.codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf_config.yaml`: `team.drive.mode: running|standby`
  - operator convenience: run `bash .codex/skills/ai-team-workflow/scripts/atwf drive running|standby` (must be outside worker tmux)

Hard rules:
- `team.drive.mode` in config is the ONLY truth; `atwf watch-idle` hot-reloads it each tick.
- Team members MUST NOT switch drive mode from inside their worker tmux sessions.
- When drive mode is `running`, **all idle + all inbox empty** is treated as an abnormal stall.
  The watcher will wake the configured `driver_role` (default: `coord`) with a `[DRIVE]` ticket.
- The driver must immediately do ONE:
  1) Kick off the next iteration by assigning owners/actions/ETAs (via `atwf action` / `atwf report-to`)
  2) Switch the team to `standby` via config (and tell Liaison/User why)
  3) Declare a blocker and create a handoff/permit when needed
- When drive mode is `standby`, the team is allowed to be fully idle with empty inbox (no drive nudges).

## Forbidden (do NOT do this)

Do **NOT** use raw tmux keystroke injection to “send” chat messages, including:

- `tmux set-buffer ...`
- `tmux paste-buffer ...`
- `tmux send-keys ...`
- any custom shell loop that pastes into sessions/panes and presses Enter

Reason: it is unreliable (can target the wrong pane, Enter can become newline, paste can be dropped), and it breaks team consistency/debuggability.

Also do **NOT** bypass policy by using `twf ask/send` directly for inter-role messaging.
If you must debug a delivery issue, ask **Coordinator** for approval and document the exact commands.

## Messaging etiquette (required)

- Recipients may be busy; replies can be delayed.
- Do not spam: if you need a reply, wait; do not re-send the same message repeatedly.
- Do not stall: unless you *must* have the recipient’s input to proceed, keep working on parallel tasks in your own scope (design/docs/tests/verification/notes) while you wait.
- If you suspect delivery failed, ask **Coordinator** to verify via logs; do not invent new raw tmux paste/send scripts.

## If you think an exception is needed

- Ask **Coordinator** first and wait for approval.
- If approved, document the exact command and outcome in `{{TEAM_DIR}}/design/<your-full>.md` so the team can reproduce/debug.
