# ai-team-workflow config (unified)
#
# This file is YAML (or JSON) and is parsed via `yaml.safe_load` when available.
#
# In this repo, `ai-team-workflow` is self-contained:
# - it bundles `tmux-workflow` (twf) and `codex-account-pool` (cap) under `deps/`
# - this single file configures atwf + twf + cap (so you don't edit multiple config files)
#
# Notes:
# - atwf reads: `share.*`, `team.*`
# - tmux-workflow (twf) reads: `codex.*`, `twf.*` (via `TWF_CODEX_CMD_CONFIG`)
# - codex-account-pool (cap) reads: `cap.*` (via env defaults injected by atwf)

        inbox id={{msg_id}} (open: {{open_cmd}})
        Rule: DO NOT change team.drive.mode or edit atwf_config.yaml (operator-only).
        Now: diagnose ({{ATWF_CMD}} state/list/inbox), then re-drive by assigning next actions (owner+ETA). If the current request is done, create/assign the next admin-* chain.
      body: |
        [DRIVE] team stalled: ALL IDLE + INBOX EMPTY
        - detected_at: {{iso_ts}}
        - meaning: In running mode (continuous iteration), this is an ABNORMAL STALL: nobody is driving work.

        Hard rule (operator-only):
        - DO NOT change team.drive.mode.
        - DO NOT edit {{ATWF_CONFIG}}.

        1) Diagnose now:
        - {{ATWF_CMD}} state
        - {{ATWF_CMD}} list
        - {{ATWF_CMD}} inbox (your own inbox)

        2) Re-drive now:
        - assign next actions (owner + next step + ETA) via {{ATWF_CMD}} action
        - if the current iteration/batch is complete, immediately kick off the next iteration: remind PM to have Prod draft the next iteration batch (features + AC/Verify), then start assignments (do not "go idle")

  # Reply-needed requests (fan-in replies without CLI injection)
  #
  # - Initiator uses: `{{ATWF_CMD}} gather ...`
  # - Targets reply via: `{{ATWF_CMD}} respond ...` (or `--blocked` to snooze reminders)
  # - Watcher will reply-drive (wake debtors) when team is stalled but replies are pending.
  reply:
    deadline: 3600        # seconds until auto-timeout / consolidation
    blocked_snooze: 900   # default snooze for `atwf respond --blocked` (seconds)

  # Message delivery (hard default behavior)
  # - Full message bodies are stored in {{TEAM_DIR}}/inbox/...
  # - Chat prompts contain only short [INBOX] id=... notifications

  # Notes:
  # - "working" agents should proactively check inbox periodically to avoid queue buildup.
